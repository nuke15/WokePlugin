# WokePlugin
Paper plugin that adds user-definable nicknames and pronouns. Overrides default chat renderer, so definitely incompatible with other plugins.

## Commands
### /pronouns <set [pronouns] / clear>
Sets/clears the player's pronoun prefix.
Note: Planning to enforce "subject/object" format.
### /nickname <set [nickname] / clear>
Sets/clears the player's nickname.
Alias: /nick
